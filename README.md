# Tracking COVID-19 in the Balkans
The purpose of this project is to determine the movement of isolates of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to and from Serbia. "Movement" involves comparing sequences and dates of appearance of a particular isolate in some neighboring countries before its appearance in Serbia, as well as displaying their clustering. It is also necessary to determine the percentage of differences of a specific isolate in Serbia that "arrived" in Serbia from neighboring countries. The data analysis technique used in this study is time series analysis.

The project is implemented in Python/JupyterNotebook
